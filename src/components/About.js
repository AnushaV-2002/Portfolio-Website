                   I'm Anusha, an information technology graduate, deeply passionate about web development and cloud computing. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I contributed as a freelance technical content writer at Scaler Academy. Here, I transformed complex tech concepts into engaging blog posts. Additionally, I worked as a web designer at Connecting the Dots, focusing on crafting intuitive user interfaces and maintaining clean code practices. As an active member of IEEE, I organized workshops, webinars, and hackathons, earning recognition with the IEEE Computer Societyâ€™s Richard E. Merwin Scholarship for my significant volunteer contributions.
